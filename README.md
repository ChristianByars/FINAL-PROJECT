For my project, the folder "CS210" was for my Django implementation. However, I was unable to connect the frontend and backend
to the API, so I used Firebase. The relevant code for what was used will all be located in the source folder that is in 
frontend (my React project). The folders that were actually used for the app are Components, Pages, utils, and assets(for photos).
